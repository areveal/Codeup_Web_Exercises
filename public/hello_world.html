		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>My name is Cole Reveal. I am a <em>junior web developer</em> and I am having an <strong>awesome</strong> time learning to code with Codeup!<br>I am hoping to use my new skills to design cool stuff and make this a career.</p>
		<h2>My favorite quote</h2>
		<blockquote>Not that I condone fascism, or any -ism for that matter. -Ism's in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon, "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." Good point there. After all, he was the walrus. I could be the walrus. I'd still have to bum rides off people. - Ferris Bueller's Day Off</blockquote>
